<p><strong>Important Points on Creating an Amazon Account</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> - Amazon accounts are pretty much automatically approved. The only thing that will cause an account application to be rejected is listing an <i>Adult site</i> or listing <i>a site with a potential trademark breach</i> (e.g. theamazonstore.com) </li>
<li> - All accounts operate independently - earnings from a USA account are paid seperately.</li>
<li> - You can create multiple "Tags" within your account to track individual websites.</li>
<li> - Inside your account, be aware of the Terms of Use and rules that Amazon make available here. Failure to follow these rules can result in your account being terminated and all your earnings suspended.</li>
<li> - Reports are updated pretty much every 24 hours. Amazon UK is updated at about 1am GMT, although Amazon USA is not as consistent with the time it is updated.</li>
<li> - You can get paid via Bank Transfer, Cheque or Gift Certificates.</li>
</ul>
